Examples: Bug fixes, documentation updates, minor improvements

**Process:**
- Submit PR with clear description
- Pass automated checks
- Get approval from one maintainer or technical lead
- Merge after 24-hour review window

#### 2. **Significant Decisions** (Team Consensus)
Examples: New features, dependency changes, refactoring

**Process:**
- Create GitHub issue or discussion
- Present proposal with rationale and alternatives
- Allow 3-7 days for feedback
- Requires approval from 2+ core team members
- Document decision in issue/PR

#### 3. **Strategic Decisions** (Community Input Required)
Examples: New projects, major architecture changes, governance updates

**Process:**

- Announce in community channels
- Allow 14+ days for community feedback
- Host discussion session if needed

### Conflict Resolution

When disagreements arise:

2. **Mediation**: If no consensus, invite neutral core team member to mediate
3. **Vote**: If still unresolved, core team votes (simple majority)
4. **Appeal**: Decisions can be appealed within 30 days with new information
