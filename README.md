## How it works

Each open tile is a hyperlink embedded in an image which tracks the number of clicks and redirects you back to our profile.
Every time the program is run it plays the move with maximum number of clicks.
It uses GitHub Actions to run every hour using a cron job.
The rest is just a regular game of Tic-Tac-Toe
